0x05-pointers, arrays, and strings

more work with mainly arrays, coding library functions such as strncpy, strcmp, and strcat. Later, we use arrays to compare against strings for encoding.

ADVANCED - improving on previously made functions such as adding an infite amount of numbers, using "magic" to print the value of 2nd element of an array with one line, and print any integer without using long.
