# 0x13-bit_manipulation

Project to use all of the bitwise operators. Contains conversion from binary to decimal and vice versa, finding, removing, and comparing bits from given indices.


## 0-binary_to_uint

	-convert binary number to an unsigned int


## 1-print_binary

	-convert decimal number to binary


## 2-get_bit

	-return value of a bin at the index


## 3-set_bit

	-set value of a bit to 1 at the index


## 4-clear_bit

	-set value of a bit to 0 at given index


## 5-flip_bits

	-return number of bits traversed from one number to the next


## 100-get_endianness

	-Function that checks from endianness


## 100-crackme3

	-find the password at https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x13.c
